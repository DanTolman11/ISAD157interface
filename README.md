## ISAD157 Database and interface

### Sample code
##### Contained in this Git repository is the sample code for the interface that i created, to display the information stored in my facebook database.
##### The interface itself, is made up of two forms, the first which displays the basic users, educational and employment information using data grid tables.
##### The second of the forms contains the messages and friends information, again displayed via data grid tables.
##### Both forms are connected via a button, said button transports between forms smoothly, simply requiring the 'Go' button to be pressed in order to load in the data.
